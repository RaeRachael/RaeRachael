### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

During 12 week coding course from Makers Academy I have strengthened both my coding can communication skills, and created a [Facebook clone with a live chat](https://github.com/tristanlangford/acebook-brainaics) and a [VIM style game](https://github.com/RaeRachael/invimcible_front_end)

Since Makers I have worked on a few personal projects;
*	An exploration game, with a [terminal version](https://github.com/RaeRachael/exploration_game) and a [web version with touch screen controls possible](https://github.com/RaeRachael/JS_exploration_game)
*	An [audio only TypeScript game](https://github.com/RaeRachael/Audio_game), which is still being improved
*	Ongoing work on adding features and maintaining the open source [administrate gem](https://github.com/thoughtbot/administrate)

Some useful links; 
* [CV on github](https://github.com/RaeRachael/CV)
* Recently completed [C# tech test](https://github.com/RaeRachael/my-chat-dotnet)
