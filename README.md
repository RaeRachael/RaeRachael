### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have just finished a 12 week coding course from Makers Academy, and will be continuing to practice the skills learnt there and develop new ones and be more comfortable in other languages. Some useful links; [CV on github](https://github.com/RaeRachael/CV), [Final project of the course (A game to help learn VIM)](https://github.com/RaeRachael/invimcible_front_end), [weeks 8-9 project (A clone of facebook)](https://github.com/tristanlangford/acebook-brainaics).

Currently while in my spare time I will be working on adding functionality via a TDD process to the [JS web version](https://github.com/RaeRachael/JS_exploration_game) of my little exploration game, the aim is to get the basic functionality to the same point as in the [Ruby terminal version](https://github.com/RaeRachael/exploration_game).
