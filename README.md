### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## current personal project

[Annotated English](https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.5962) is a concept written up in 2010 by JosÂ´e HernÂ´andez-Orallo, I have been working on extending it to return plainstrings using unicode character for the annotations. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/RaeRachael/Annontated-English), with the current react app deployed via [surge](https://annotated-english.surge.sh/)
